# capstone_project_wellness_tech
This is a case study from Google Data Analytics Certification program for the wellness technology company. In this case study, I analyzed the public data [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) that explores smart device usersâ€™ daily habits in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and applied the insights to one [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) product.

### This capstone project contains the following files:
* The **R markdown file** for Analysis of FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.
* A **PDF** that shows the R codes and the outputs.
* A **report** with summary of the analysis, supportive isualizations and key findings, and recommendations.
* Some graphs.
* **SQL code file (BigQuery)** for the analysis.
